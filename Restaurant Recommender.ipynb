    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will extract restaurant ratings and reviews from [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) and use distance (one of the main ideas behind recommender systems) to generate recommendations for restaurants in one city that have similar reviews to restaurants in another city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I grew up in Austin, Texas, and moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota within the last three years. My wife and I are people who love food, and loved the food culture in Austin. After our move, we wanted to find new restaurants to replace our favorites from back home.  However, most decently rated places in Minneapolis we went to just didn't quite live up to our Austin expectations.  These restaurants usually came at the recommendations of locals, acquaintances, or from Google ratings, but the food was often bland and overpriced.  It took us one deep dive into the actual reviews to figure it out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better illustrate our problem, below are recent reviews from three restaurants that left us disappointed.  On the left is a pizza shop, the middle is a typical American restaurant, and the right is a Vietnamese restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: left; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XZ00nBV.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: right; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9C8c1ql.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: none!important; display: block; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/D15CLBU.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "I highlighted the main points to stand out against the small font. Service, atmosphere, and apparently eggrolls were the most common and unifying factors. You see very little discussion on the quality of the actual food,  and you can even see an instance where a reviewer rates the pizza place as 5/5 even after saying that it is pricey. I began to notice a disconnect in how I evaluate restaurants versus how the people of Minneapolis evaluate restaurants. If you have previously worked with recommender systems, you already know where I'm going with this. If not, here is a primer:\n",

    "### Recommender Systems Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the overview of recommender systems, I wanted to point out that I won't actually be building a legitimate recommender system in this notebook.  There are some [great](https://turi.com/learn/userguide/recommender/introduction.html) [packages](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) for doing so, but I'm going to stick with one of the main ideas behind recommender systems.  This is for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Classes have started back up, and my available free time for side projects like this one is almost non-existant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** My gastronomic adventures don't need the added benefits that a recommender system provides over what I'll be doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get back into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of recommender systems, there are three broad types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Collaborative Filtering (user-user)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)**: The most prevalent type uses \"wisdom of the crowd\" for popularity among peers. This option is particularly popular because you don't need to know a lot about the item itself, you only need the ratings submitted by reviewers. The two primary restrictions are that it makes the assumption that peoples' tastes do not change over time, and new items run into the \"[cold start problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start)\".  This is when either a new item has not yet received any ratings and fails to appear on recommendation lists, or a new user has not reviewed anything so we don't know what their tastes are.\n",
    "    - **E.x.:** People who like item **X** also like item **Y**\n",
    "        - This is how Spotify selects songs for your recommended play list.  Specifically, it will take songs from other play lists that contain songs you recently liked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **[Content-Based (item-item)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Content-based_filtering)**: This method recommends items based off of their similarity to other items.  This requires reliable information about the items themselves, which makes it difficult to implement in a lot of cases.  Additionally, recommendations generated from this will option likely not deviate very far from the item being compared to, but there are tricks available to account for this.\n",
    "    - **E.x.:** Item **X** is similar to item **Y**\n",
    "        - This is how Pandora selects songs for your stations.  Specifically, it assigns each song a list of characteristics (assigned through the [Music Genome Project](http://www.pandora.com/corporate/mgp.shtml)), and selects songs with similar characteristics as those that you liked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Hybrid_recommender_systems)**: You probably guessed it - this is a combination of the above two types.  The idea here is use what you have if you have it. [Here](http://www.math.uci.edu/icamp/courses/math77b/lecture_12w/pdfs/Chapter%2005%20-%20Hybrid%20recommendation%20approaches.pdf) are a few designs related to this that are worth looking into.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the three main types, but there is one additional type that you may find if you are diving a little deeper into the subject material:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Knowledge-Based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_recommender_system)**: This is is the most rare type mainly because it requires explicit domain knowledge. It is often used for products that have a low number of available ratings, such as high luxury goods like hypercars. We won't delve any further into this type, but I recommend reading more about it if you're interested in the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to our problem. The previous way of selecting restaurants at the recommendation of locals and acquaintances (collaborative filtering) wasn't always successful, so we are going to use the idea behind content-based recommender systems to evaluate our options.  However, we don't have a lot of content about the restaurants available, so we are going to primarily use the reviews people left for them.  More specifically, we are going to determine similarity between restaurants based off of the similarity of the reviews that people have written for them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use cosine similarity since it's generally accepted as producing better results in item-to-item filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{8cm}sim(A, B) = \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\|\\|B\\|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before calculating this, we need to perform a couple of pre-processing steps on our reviews in order to make the data  usable for our cosine similarity calculation.  These will be common NLP (**n**atural **l**anguage **p**rocessing) techniques that you should be familiar with if you have worked with text before.  These are the steps I took, but I am open to feedback and improvement if you have recommendations on different or improved methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Normalizing**: This step converts our words into lower case so that when we map to our feature space, we don't end up with redundant features for the same words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ex. \"Central Texas barbecue is the best smoked and the only barbecue that matters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1.75cm}$becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"central texas barbecue is the best smoked and the only barbecue that matters\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Tokenizing**: This step breaks up a sentence into individual words, essentially turning our reviews into [bags of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model), which makes it easier to perform other operations.  Though we are going to perform many other preprocessing operations, this is more or less the beginning of mapping our reviews into the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ex. 'Central Texas barbecue is the best smoked and the only barbecue that matters'\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1.75cm}$becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    ['Central', 'Texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Removing Stopwords and Punctuation**: This step removes unnecessary words and punctuation often used in language that computers don't need such as *as*, *the*, *and*, and *of*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ex. ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters']\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1.75cm}$becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoked', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matters']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Lemmatizing (Stemming)**: Lemmatizing (which is very similar to stemming) removes variations at the end of a word to revert words to their root word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ex. ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoked', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matters']\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1.75cm}$becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoke', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matter']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: This technique determines how important a word is to a document (which is a review in this case) within a corpus (the collection documents, or all reviews).  This doesn't necessarily help establish context within our reviews themselves (for example, 'this Pad Kee Mao is bad ass' is technically a good thing, which wouldn't be accounted for unless we did [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) (which will give my laptop a much more difficult time)), but it does help with establishing the importance of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{8cm}TFIDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \\cdot IDF(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{8cm}IDF(t) =  1 + \\log\\Big(\\frac{\\#\\ Documents}{\\#\\ Documents\\ Containing\\ t}\\Big)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{8cm}t:\\ \\text{Term}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{8cm}d:\\ \\text{Document}$\n",
    "\n",
    "On a side note, sarcasm, slang, misspellings, emoticons, and context are common problems in NLP, but we will be ignoring these due to time limitations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always important to state your assumptions in any analysis because a violation of them will often impact the reliability of the results.  My assumptions in this case are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reviews are indicative of the characteristics of the restaurant\n",
    "- The language used in the reviews does not directly impact the rating a user gives\n",
    "     - E.g. Reviews contain a description of their experience, but ratings are the result of the user applying weights to specific things they value\n",
    "         - Ex. \"The food was great, but the service was terrible.\" would be a 2/10 for one user, but a 7/10 for users like myself\n",
    "- The restaurants did not undergo significant changes in the time frame for the reviews being pulled\n",
    "- Sarcasm, slang, misspellings, and other common NLP problems will not have a significant impact on our results\n",

    "\n",
    "Foursquare works similarly to Yelp where users will review restaurants.  They can either leave a rating (1-10), or write a review for the restaurant.  The review is what we're interested in here since I established above that the rating has less meaning due to the way people rate restaurants differently between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) was fortunately fairly robust.  I used the [foursquare categoryID tree](https://developer.foursquare.com/categorytree) in order to grab the venue category ID for the different types of restaurants.  The [venue search](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search) function grabs the actual restaurants, and the [tips](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/tips) function returns the reviews (and not what users left for a tip like you'd think).\n",

There are also a few grocery stores (such as Whole Foods and the magnificent [H-E-B](https://www.heb.com/)) that appear under the bakery and deli categories, so excluding this is easier than manually filtering them out.  I left them commented out so there is the full list in case anyone else would like to include them for their own uses."

Prepare for that.Lunch specials are great & service is always good.If you don\\'t like lemon juice in your water, make sure to ask for it without.The burgers here are awesome! Freshly ground sirloin! Yummy!Try the Wild West Shrimp. Plenty to share. Yum!!!Customer service here is at 110%. Best service of any longhorns that I have been to across Texas.I was enjoying my salad when I bit into something odd.  It turned out to be a shard of clear hard plastic. I called the manager over. He replied, \"glad you didn\\'t swallow that\". Not even an apology.I ordered a pork chop dinner and they brought me ribs. Talk about disorganized, plus I had to wait an hour for the pork chops.This isn\\'t Ruth\\'s Chris; understanding that is key to having a good time.The Mula drink it\\'s excellentI can\\'t believe they don\\'t have Dr Pepper here; come on, this Texas, it\\'s a requirement!!!The broccoli cheese soup was good!The passion/pineapple vodka is yummy!!!!Excelente lugarBuen servicio.This place is trash, save ur money !

Both seek to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form, but they go about it in different ways.  In order to illustrate the difference, here's a dictionary entry:\n",

    "Lemmatization seeks to get the *lemma*, or the base dictionary form of the word.  In our example above, that would be \"graduate\".  It does this by using vocabulary and a morphological analysis of the words, rather than just chopping off the variations (the \"verb forms\" in the example above) like a traditional stemmer would.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of lemmatization here is that we don't run into issues like our other example of *university* $\\rightarrow$ *universe* that can happen in conventional stemmers.  It is also relatively quick on this data set!\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that it is not able to infer if the word is a noun/verb/adjective/etc., so we have to specify which type it is.  Since we're looking at, well, everything, we're going to lemmatize for nouns, verbs, and adjectives.\n",
