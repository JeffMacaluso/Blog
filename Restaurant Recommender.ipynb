    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will extract restaurant ratings and reviews from [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/), and use distance (one of the main ideas behind recommender systems) to generate recommendations for restaurants in one city that have similar reviews to restaurants in another city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I grew up in Austin, Texas, but moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota for my wife's work.  Being people who love food, we had to find new restaurants to replace our favorites from back home.  However, most decently rated places we went to were...lacking.  They came at the recommendations of coworkers,  neighbors, or from Google ratings, but the food was often bland and overpriced.  It took us one look at the actual reviews to figure it out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better illustrate our problem, here are recent reviews from three places we tried that we were disappointed in.  On the left is a pizza shop, the middle is a typical American restaurant, and the right is a Vietnamese restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: left; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XZ00nBV.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: right; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9C8c1ql.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: none!important; display: block; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/D15CLBU.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The font may be too small to read, but I highlighted the main points.  Service, atmosphere, and apparently eggrolls were the common factors.  You don't see a lot of mentions of how good the actual food is, and you can even see an instance of someone rating the pizza place as 5/5 even after saying that it is pricey.  So, obviously, there is a disconnect in how I evaluate restaurants versus how the people of Minneapolis evaluate restaurants.  If you have previously worked with recommender systems, you already know where I'm going with this.  If not, here is a primer:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommender Systems Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the overview of recommender systems, I wanted to point out that I won't actually be building a legitimate recommender system in this notebook.  There are some [great](https://turi.com/learn/userguide/recommender/introduction.html) [packages](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) for doing so, but I'm going to stick with one of the main ideas behind recommender systems.  This is for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Classes have started back up, and my available free time for side projects like this one has mostly dried up\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** My gastronomic adventures don't need the added benefits that a recommender system provides over what I'll be doing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're still interested after that, let's get back into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of recommender systems, there are three broad types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Collaborative Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)**: The most prevalent type - uses \"wisdom of the crowd\" for popularity among peers.  This is so popular because you don't need to know a lot about the item itself, you only need the ratings on it from people.  The two restrictions are that it has the assumption that peoples tastes do not change, and new items run into the \"cold start problem\".  This is when it has not yet received any ratings, and fails to appear on recommendation lists.\n",
    "    - People who like item X also like item Y\n",
    "    - This is how Spotify selects songs for your recommended playlist.  Specifically, it will take songs from other playlists that contain songs you recently liked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **[Content-Based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Content-based_filtering)**: Recommends items based off of their similarity.  This requires reliable information about the items themselves, which makes it difficult to implement in a lot of areas.  Additionally, recommendations generated from this will likely not deviate very far from the item being compared to, but there are tricks available to account for this.  This is similar to how Pandora's model for selecting songs on a station.\n",
    "    - Item X is similar to item Y\n",
    "    - This is how Pandora selects songs for your stations.  Specifically, it assigns each song a list of characteristics (assigned through the [Music Genome Project](http://www.pandora.com/corporate/mgp.shtml)), and selects songs with similar characteristics as those that you liked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Hybrid_recommender_systems)**: You probably guessed it - this is a combination of the above two.  The idea here is use what you have if you have it.  There are a few designs of this [worth looking into](http://www.math.uci.edu/icamp/courses/math77b/lecture_12w/pdfs/Chapter%2005%20-%20Hybrid%20recommendation%20approaches.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the three main types, but there is one other type that you may find if you are reading more:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Knowledge-Based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_recommender_system)**: This is the most rare type due to requiring explicit domain knowledge.  This is often used for products that have a low number of available ratings, such as high luxury goods like hypercars.  We won't delve any further into this type, but I recommend reading more about them if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our problem, the previous way of selecting restaurants at the recommendation of our coworkers and neighbors (collaborative filtering) failed, so we are going to used the idea behind content-based recommender systems.  However, we don't have a lot of content about the restaurants, so we are going to use the reviews people left for them.  More specifically, we are going to determine similarity between restaurants based off of the reviews that people write for them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use cosine similarity since it's generally accepted as producing better results in item-to-item filtering.  Specifically,\n",
    "\n",
    "$sim(A, B) = \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\|\\|B\\|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before calculating this, we need to perform a couple of pre-processing steps on our reviews in order to make it more useable for our cosine similarity calculation.  These will be common NLP (**n**atural **l**anguage **p**rocessing) techniques that you should be familiar with if you have worked with text before.  There are likely better ways to go about the text processing for this problem (and please let me know if you believe there are so I can update this when I have time), but here are the steps I will be taking:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Tokenizing**: This breaks up a sentence into individual words.  This is basically turning our reviews into [bags of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model), which makes it easier to perform other operations.\n",
    "- Ex. 'Central Texas barbecue is the best smoked and the only barbecue that matters' becomes\n",
    "    - ['Central', 'Texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters']\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Sentiment Analysis**: While not a pre-processing technique, it will be a useful to include when determining similarity. There are a few reasons to this **[go into why, and why doing it here, and examples]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Normalizing**: This just means converting our tokens into lower case.  Like tokenizing, this makes it play nicely with other operations.\n",
    "- Ex. ['Central', 'Texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters'] becomes \n",
    "    - ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters']\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Removing Stopwords and Punctuation**: Takes out unnecessary words and punctuation that we use in language that computers don't care about such as *as*, *the*, *and*, and *of*\n",
    "- Ex. ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'smoked', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'barbecue', 'that', 'matters'] becomes \n",
    "    - ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoked', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matters']\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Stemming**: Removes variations at the end of a word to revert words to their root\n",
    "- Ex. ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoked', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matters'] becomes\n",
    "    - ['central', 'texas', 'barbecue', 'best', 'smoke', 'only', 'barbecue', 'matter']\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Determines how important a word is to a document (which is a review in this case) within a corpus (the collection documents).  This doesn't necessarily help establish context within our reviews themselves (for example, 'this Pad Kee Mao is bad ass' is technically a good thing, but it wouldn't be accounted for unless we did [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) (which will give my laptop a much more difficult time)), but it does help with establishing the importance of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "$t$: Term\n",
    "\n",
    "$d$: Document\n",
    "\n",
    "$TFIDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \\cdot IDF(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$IDF(t) =  1 + \\log(\\frac{\\#\\ Documents}{\\#\\ Documents\\ Containing\\ t})$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of areas in NLP that cause difficulties that we will be ignoring due to the nature of our problem. Sarcasm, slang, misspellings, and context are common problems in NLP, but we will be ignoring these due to the limitation on time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always important to state your assumptions in any analysis because a violation of them will often render the results unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reviews are indicative of the characteristics of the restaurant\n",
    "- The language used in the reviews does not directly impact the rating\n",
    "     - E.g. Reviews contain a description of their experience, but ratings are the result of the user applying weights to specific things they value\n",
    "     - Ex. \"The food was great, but the service was terrible.\" would be a 2/10 for one user, but a 7/10 for users like myself\n",
    "- The restaurants did not undergo significant changes in the time frame for the reviews being pulled\n",
    "- Sarcasm, slang, misspellings, and other common NLP problems will not have a significant impact on our results\n",

    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare works similarly to Yelp where users will review restaurants.  They can either leave a rating (1-10), or write a comment for the restaurant.  The comment is what we're interested in here since I established above that the rating has less meaning due to the way people rate restaurants differently between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) was fortunately fairly robust.  I used the [foursquare categoryID tree](https://developer.foursquare.com/categorytree) in order to grab the venue category ID for the different types of restaurants.  The [venue search](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search) function grabs the actual restaurants, and the [tips](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/tips) function returns the comments (and not what users left for a tip like you'd think).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the individual comments, restaurant category, price tier, and the number of check-ins, comments, and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restaurants\n",
    "\n",
    "Before pulling our restaurants, we have to first include a few parameters.  We'll begin with the cities we want to include and the restaurant types we want to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're not interested in chains or fast food places, we have to specify which venue category IDs we want.  There are also a few grocery stores (such as Whole Foods and the magnificent [H-E-B](https://www.heb.com/)) that appear under the bakery and deli categories, so excluding this is easier than manually filtering them out.  I left them commented out so there is the full list in case anyone else would like to include them for their own uses."
